This small library implements the PRESENT lightweight block cipher. The
algorithm was first presented in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-74735-2_31).
Although the cipher is designed to be implemented directly on hardware,
this project aims to provide it in software, which can be used e.g. for
testing purposes.

This project is independent of the original paper and not affiliated with
the authors of that paper in any way.
